desc : "Each player rolls a colored cube over a map made of cubes. The player cubes stick to the map at any time, even if you roll over the edge of the map. Every time your cube touches one or more fields which had not your color before, they will switch. Try to capture as many fields as you can before the game ends. Helpful items appear to handicap your enemys or boost yourself. You can play against the AI, in splitscreen and via network."
